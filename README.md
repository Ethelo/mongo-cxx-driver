##Warning
# This is a trivial modification of the MongoDB C++ driver that removes a single flag (--Wall) from a legacy tagged build that we happen to use internally. If you're not working on Ethelo, you almost certainly do not want this fork. You want [the original](//github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver).

# MongoDB C++ Driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.svg?branch=26compat)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver)
Welcome to the MongoDB C++ Driver!

Please see our [wiki page](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/wiki/Download-and-Compile-the-Legacy-Driver) for information about building, testing, and using the driver.

  Version [legacy-0.0-26compat-2.6.12](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/tree/legacy-0.0-26compat-2.6.11) of the
  C++ legacy driver has been released. Please report any bugs or issues in the C++
  [JIRA project](http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX).

Use this branch only if you have existing code that used the driver
from the server source and want it to continue working without
modification. Switch to the "legacy" branch if you had previosuly been
using 26compat (or the driver inside of the server source) and want to
benefit from incremental improvements while having the same overall
API. Switch to the "master" branch if you are using MongoDB's C++
driver for the first time.

> **Note:** As of MongoDB 2.6.0-rc1, it is no longer possible to build the driver from the server sources: this repository is the only approved source for driver builds.

## Components

  - `libmongoclient.[so|dylib|dll]` - The shared mongoclient library (but see notes)
  - `libmongoclient.a` - The static mongoclient library

## Building and Usage

  - [Download and Compile](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/wiki/Download%20and%20Compile)
  - [Tutorial](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/wiki/Tutorial)

## Bugs and Issues

  See http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX

## Notes

  Use of the shared library is experimental on windows and is currently
  discouraged. This is primarily due to the complexity of ensuring a matching
  implementation of STL types between library and consumer code. This problem
  is unique to windows, as the consistent use of system libraries largely
  mitigates this danger.
